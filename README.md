## Web Images


### Objectives

- Export images for the Web using Photoshop


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-05` (or `exercise-05-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- coral-reef.jpg
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-05` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-05` folder. (It may be named `exercise-05-master`.)

1. In Photoshop, re-size the `coral-reef.jpg` so it has a resolution of 72 dpi and is 600 pixels wide.

2. Use Export > Save for Web (Legacy) to create multiple versions of the photo. Create one jpg for each quality setting (low, medium, high, very high and maximum).

  Adjust the quality percentage to a number which allows you to get the file size as low as possible without degrading the quality too much.

  (For instance, you might adjust 'low' to 7 or 8 and the quality may look okay. Dropping it one more may lead to 'jaggies.' Find the happy medium.)

  Be sure to name the files accordingly based on the file name already coded in the `img` tag.  

3. Each time you save a photo, write down the file size and the quality setting (i.e. Low, 5%, 26.5k).

4. Add the settings you recorded in the HTML file for future reference.


### Extra Practice

Make a copy of `index.html` and name it `my-photos.html`.

Visit Wikipedia and find a photo of your choice which is either in the public domain or licensed through [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons). Download the "Original File" file so you'll have the biggest image to work with.

Add HTML to `my-photos.html` giving attribution to the photographer. (You may do this as you see fit given the same image is used five times.)

Repeat the instructions above -- re-size, crop and export for all quality settings. Again, make note of the file size and quality settings. Add the edited images and text to `my-photos.html`.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
